Once all bioclimatic data has been compiled (point and/or polygon) you can create range maps from the vectors created to visually compare distributions over bioclimatic ranges

To being, plot a blank map. For these purposes, the map can be isolated to the New World. You will also need the maps package

```
load(maps)
map('world',xlim = c(-175,-35), ylim = c(-70,90), fill = TRUE, col = "grey")
```
Next you can plot your bioclim variable of choice over this map and add point or polygon data to it

```
plot(bio1)
points(CircaeaCoord, col = "red", pch = 20, cex = 0.25)
```
OR

```
plot(bio1)
plot(Circaearange, add=T, col="light green")
```

From here you can add other taxa, sister taxa, or change bioclimatic variables
