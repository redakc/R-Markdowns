## Creating a list of sister taxa

In addition to the already installed packages, we also will need the following: 

```
load(base)
```

To isolate the sister taxa from the phylogenies we have created, we first need to generate a list of the focal and sister clade species. This command accesses the coded tree and creates a vector of all the tip labels from the tree.

```
Circaeatotal=c(circaeaphy$tip.label)
```

Next, we can use the "setdiff" function from the "base" package to differentiate the tip labels of the sister taxa from the tip labels of the focal clade, resulting in a list of sister taxa

```
Circaeasister=setdiff(Circaeatotal, Circaea)
```
